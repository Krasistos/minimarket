## Step 4: Deploy to Production

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, follow these key steps to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. You can also check the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more details.

### Deploy using Mau
If you're looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com). Mau is an official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. To deploy with Mau:

1. Install Mau globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
